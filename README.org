* Open Editions

The Open Editions project publishes richly annotated open source literary texts. We aim to aggregate the literary knowledge that surrounds a text, codify that knowledge, and integrate it into the text. [[https://github.com/open-editions/article-jjq/blob/master/open-editions-online.pdf][Read the draft article for /James Joyce Quarterly/ where we discuss the project and its preliminary goals.]]

This is the master repository for the Open Editions website, [[http://open-editions.org][Open-Editions.org]]. The issues here represent meta-todo items for all texts.

** Website: technical details. 

This website is built from markdown, using Rib, Shake, and other Haskell tools. To build it, make sure you have Nix installed, and then run: 

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
nix-shell --run 'ghcid -T main generate' 
#+END_SRC

Or to build it and watch the directory for changes, just remove ~generate~. 

Most of the layout is in Main.hs. Edition metadata is in Editions.hs, for now.
